    <h2> Description  </h2>
    <p>   Aloo Ghobi is a vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent made with potatoes, cauliflower, and Indian spices. It is popular in Indian and Pakistani cuisines. It is yellowish in colour due to the use of turmeric, and occasionally contains kalonji and curry leaves.     </p>
    <p>     Aloo gobi is a zesty and comforting Indian side or main dish made with fresh cauliflower and tender potatoes. Here I share with you step-by-step instructions and photos for two different but equally delicious aloo gobi recipes: A rich and creamy restaurant style version, and a slightly lighter dry sabji variation.        </p>
   
   <ul>   <h2> Ingredients Required </h2>
   <li> 2 Medium Potatoes  </li>
   <li> 2 Cups Cauliflower Florets (Ghobhi) (180 grams)   </li>
   <li> 1 Medium Onion    </li>
   <li> 1 Medium Tomato   </li>
   <li> 1 Tablespoon Ginger Garlic Minced    </li>
   <li> 1 Green Chili     </li>
   <li> 0.5 Teaspoon Salt     </li>
	<li> 2 Tablespoons Oil			</li>
	<li> 0.5 Teaspoon Cumin Seeds (Jeera)			</li>
   	<li> 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala	</li>
	<li> 0.75 Teaspoon Coriander Powder    		</li>
	<li> 0.75 To 1 Teaspoon Red Chilli Powder	</li>
	<li> 1 Teaspoon Kasuri Methi			</li>

          </ul>
    
     <ol>     <h2> Steps </h2>
    <li> Chop Cauliflower Florets to 1.5 inch in size. Add them to slightly hot water and set aside 3 to 4 mins.  </li> 
    <li> Drain the water and rinse them well. Drain them completely.  </li>
    <li> Cube potatoes to 0.75 by 0.75 inch. You can also slice them to 0.75 inch. Keep them immersed in a bowl of water until used. Keeping them in water helps the potatoes to cook faster as hey soak up some moisture. </li>
    <li> Mince garlic and ginger  </li>   
    <li> Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. When they sizzle, add ginger garlic and saute for 30 seconds.       </li>
    <li> Add SALT AND continue to cook covered on a low flame until the potatoes are soft & fully cooked.      </li>
    <li> The veegie will release moisture at this stage and cook quickly. So keep an eye not to over cook gobhi at this stage. It must remain slightly yet cooked.       </li>
	<li> Next add the tomatoes and kasuri methi. Fry on a medium to high flame until the raw smell of tomatoes goes away		</li>
	<li> Finally, Garnish Aloo Gobhi with coriander leaves. Serve with rice, roti or any bread.		</li>

 		</ol>
