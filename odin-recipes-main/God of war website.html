    <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-in/god-of-war/">  God of War </a>
     is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 2005 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2">PlayStation 2 (PS2)</a> video game console, and has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of eight games across multiple platforms with a ninth currently in development.
     <div class="abcd ala"> Based in ancient mythology, the story follows the titular protagonist, Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the original Greek god of war Ares. </div>
      This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the mythological pantheons. The Greek mythology era of the series sees Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse mythology era, which introduces his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist, shows an older Kratos on a path of redemption, which inadvertently brings the two into conflict with the Norse gods. </strong></p>


<p class="second-para"> <strong>  Santa Monica has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and Javaground/Sony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital.  The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2005_video_game)">God of War (2005)</a>  , God of War II (2007), and God of War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, Ascension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include Chains of Olympus (2008) and <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War:_Ghost_of_Sparta">Ghost of Sparta (2010) </a> for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal (2007) for mobile phones that supported the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 installment that was also titled God of War and released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Microsoft Windows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger. A sequel, Ragnar√∂k, is in development for a 2022 release on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and will be the finale to the Norse era. </p>  </strong>
